2. **Click "New Issue"**: Look for the green "New Issue" button in the top-right corner
3. **Choose an issue template** (if available): Select the template that best matches your issue type
4. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Title**: Provide a clear, concise description of the issue
   - **Description**: Include:
     - What happened (or what feature you're requesting)
     - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
     - Expected behavior
     - Actual behavior
     - Environment details (browser, OS, versions, etc.)
     - Screenshots or logs if applicable
5. **Add labels** (optional): If you have permissions, add relevant labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.
6. **Submit**: Click "Submit new issue"

### For Users Without a GitHub Account

If you don't have a GitHub account, you have several options:

#### Option 1: Create a Free GitHub Account (Recommended)
Creating a GitHub account is free and takes only a few minutes:
1. Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Follow the registration process
3. Once registered, follow the instructions above for users with accounts

#### Option 2: Contact via Alternative Channels
Since GitHub requires an account to create issues, you can report issues through alternative channels:

- **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly (check organization documentation for contact email)
- **Discord/Slack**: If the TTC organization has a community Discord or Slack, post your issue there
- **Social Media**: Reach out via official social media channels
- **Discussion Forums**: Some projects have discussion forums or community boards

**When reporting via alternative channels, please include:**
- Clear issue title
- Detailed description
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment information
- Any relevant screenshots or error messages

#### Option 3: Ask Someone to File on Your Behalf
If you know someone with a GitHub account who uses the TTC Ecosystem, you can ask them to file the issue for you.
