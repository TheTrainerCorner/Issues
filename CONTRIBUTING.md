# Contributing to TTC Ecosystem

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the TTC (TheTrainerCorner) Ecosystem! This document provides guidelines for reporting issues.

## Reporting Issues

This repository serves as the central location for reporting issues across all TTC Ecosystem projects.

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues**: Check if someone has already reported the same issue
2. **Verify the issue**: Make sure it's reproducible and not a local configuration problem
3. **Gather information**: Collect relevant details, error messages, and environment information

### Creating an Issue

#### With a GitHub Account

1. Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/TheTrainerCorner/Issues/issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select the appropriate issue template:
   - **Bug Report**: For reporting bugs or unexpected behavior
   - **Feature Request**: For suggesting new features or enhancements
   - **Documentation**: For documentation improvements
   - **Question**: For asking questions
4. Fill in all relevant sections of the template
5. Submit the issue

#### Without a GitHub Account

If you don't have a GitHub account, you have these options:

1. **Create a free GitHub account** (recommended): Visit [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. **Use alternative communication channels**: Email or social media (check TTC organization for contact details)
3. **Ask someone to report it**: Have someone with a GitHub account file the issue on your behalf

### Issue Quality Guidelines

To help us address issues efficiently, please:

- **Use descriptive titles**: Make it easy to understand the issue at a glance
- **Provide complete information**: Fill out all relevant template sections
- **Be specific**: Include exact error messages, steps to reproduce, and environment details

- **Stay on topic**: Keep each issue focused on a single problem or request
- **Be respectful**: Follow our code of conduct and treat others with respect
- **Follow up**: Respond to questions and provide additional information if requested

### What Happens After You Submit?

1. **Triage**: Maintainers will review and label your issue
2. **Discussion**: There may be questions or requests for clarification
3. **Resolution**: The issue will be addressed, fixed, or closed with an explanation
4. **Notification**: You'll be notified of all updates via GitHub notifications
